# Proposal Summary
The $2192 token ecosystem has shown remarkable growth and engagement among active users, particularly through the participation in the batel. However, a subset of dormant whalesâ€”those who received the $2192 airdrop but did not participate in the burn or the batel - pose a potential threat to the market dynamics. Their inactivity, coupled with the holding of substantial token quantities, could destabilize the ecosystem when they decide to move or sell their tokens.

To mitigate this risk and promote a more balanced and dynamic market, I propose a strategy to encourage these dormant whales to become active participants or reduce their impact through a token swap mechanism.

# Problem Statement
Dormant whales, by virtue of holding large amounts of $2192 tokens without participating in burn or batel, create an overhang that can lead to market manipulation or unexpected price fluctuations. Active users were incentivized to burn 90% of their airdrop and engage actively, contributing positively to the ecosystem. It is crucial to address the potential risk posed by these dormant accounts.

# Proposed Solution: Token Swap and Controlled Decay Mechanism
I propose implementing a token swap mechanism that encourages engagement from dormant whales while safeguarding the interests of active participants. This mechanism will be structured as follows:

1. Token Swap Announcement: The swap from $2192 to $2192v2 will be available to all users and advertised for a period of one week before it commences.
2. Initial Swap Ratio: The swap will begin with a 1:1 ratio, meaning each $2192 token can be exchanged for one $2192v2 token.
3. Decay Mechanism: Starting 24 hours after the swap begins, the ratio will decay at a rate of 1% per hour. This means that the swap ratio will decrease progressively over time.
    * After the first 24 hours, the swap ratio will start decreasing from 1:1 to lower ratios.
    * The decay continues until the ratio reaches 1:0.1, approximately 10 days from the start.
4. Permanent Pause: Once the ratio reaches 1:0.1, the swap will be paused indefinitely at this rate. This means that $2192 tokens can be swapped for $2192v2 tokens at a maximum ratio of 1:0.1 forever.
5. Whitelist for Batel Participants: Accounts that participated in the batel event will be whitelisted to always receive a 1:1 swap ratio, irrespective of the ongoing decay. This incentivizes active participants and rewards their engagement.

# Impact and Benefits
* Encourages Activity: Dormant whales are incentivized to either become active or accept a significantly lower value for their tokens if they remain inactive.
* Rewards Active Users: Active participants are rewarded with the ability to always swap at a favorable rate, potentially allowing them to buy from inactive users at a lower price and benefit from price arbitrage.
* Gamification: The dynamic swap ratio creates opportunities for strategic trading and engagement, enhancing market interest and activity.

# Implementation Plan
1. Announcement and Communication: Inform the community about the token swap details, emphasizing the benefits and the decay mechanism. Provide clear guidelines on how to participate in the swap.
2. Technical Development: Implement the smart contract for the swap, ensuring the decay function is accurately programmed and the whitelist for batel participants is established.
3. Monitoring and Support: Monitor the swap process, provide support for participants, and address any technical issues promptly.
4. Post-Swap Evaluation: Assess the impact of the swap on market dynamics and participant behavior. Use the insights to inform future strategies and enhancements.

# Conclusion
The proposed token swap with a controlled decay mechanism is a strategic approach to managing dormant whales in the $2192 ecosystem. By encouraging engagement and protecting active users, we can foster a more dynamic and stable market environment, ensuring the long-term health and success of the $2192 token community.
